// Golang's function may be a closure.
// Closure is a programming language feature. It is a function such
// that all variables it uses will still work outside where it is defined.

// A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its
// body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables; in
// this sense the function is "bound" to the variables.
// Each closure is bound to its own variables.

// For example:
//   1. a function f defines a local variable x and a local function c
//   2. x is used in c
//   3. f returns c
//   4. f is called and result is assigned to d
//   5. d is now a function that is c. all variables used by d, including x
//  still work, even though they were local variables of f
//   6. d is called a closure

// In practice, closure means you can create a function that maintains a state,
// without using global variable.

// You create a closure by defining a function that returns a function. Then
// call the function and assign the result to a variable. The variable is a new
// function, a closure.

// Closure is basically the core concept of "class and object" in object-oriented
// programming languages, like Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

			a = x
		}
		return getter, setter
	}

	var get, set = class(1)
	fmt.Printf("get(): %v\n", get()) // get(): 1
	fmt.Println("set(3)")
